                                On Friday Big Brothers United hosted a youth awakening workshop in Beaconsfield in order to educate
                                the youth on the danger of drug and alcohol. The workshop was a huge success and later Big Brothers
                                united entertained the youth with a gospel show that was done in collaboration with the local church
                                Christian Apostolic Faith Ministries under the administration of Apostle Noel Erasmus.
